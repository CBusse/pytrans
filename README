pytrans 0.01 (September 2022)
-----------------------

This script is a python3 port from Klaus Peichl's Transfolio(1)

From Transfolio README:
"
Transfolio is a file transfer utility that connects a PC to the Atari Portfolio
pocket computer over the parallel port. It communicates with the built-in file
transfer software of the Portfolio.
"
The behavior of this Script is basically 1:1 the same to 
the original c Tool - except for one minor detail: 

This Script only works with the usblpt(3) Adapter designed by Henrik Haftmann(2)
